# Top 3 Art Mediums (for me) 
#### Here, I'll be listing my three favorite art mediums that I have tried so far, as well as some examples of my art for each medium. 
## 3. Charcoal

One of my favorite art mediums that I discovered recently is charcoal. Because blending is so easy, I found it a very fun medium to work with, as all I would need are charcoal pencils, kneaded eraser, and a blending stump.

## 2. Oil Pastels

Just like with Charcoal, I enjoy using Oil Pastels due to how easily I can blend them. It's honestly much more tedious to work with than charcoal, as I only have a limited set of colors and have to find the right colors to mix to achieve the colors I want (especially when I need to color match to a real object). Despite this however, I find this medium to be extremely enjoyable once you roughly get the hang of it. 

## 1. Digital

Last but not least is my favorite medium, digital. To be honest, I don't think that I'm particularly great at using digital art. In fact, I feel like the other two listed mediums yield better results for me. Nevertheless, the versatility and convenience that comes from the wide selection of tools and brushes makes digital art fun. It's also the medium that I used the most consistently for the longest time, as I have been drawing digitally since 6th grade.
